# Fashion-MNIST-ML-Image-Classification

One of the first courses I took on Machine Learning was an Image Classification course that used the MNIST library to predict an image of a number. I decided to expand on the lessons I learned from that course here. 

In this project, I took the Fashion-MNIST library and applied machine learning techniques to build a model to predict an article of clothing depicted in an image. The objective is to display what I learned from that course, and build a model that outputs at least an 85% accuracy (both model output and evaluation) with the least amount of loss.

The model built here acheived the accuracy objective, however, I feel the loss associated with the model could have been minimized a bit further. 

This was a quick and dirty mini-project that I used to test my skills, so I accepted the model at it's current state for time's sake. If this project were to be expanded, I would like to try other neural network models, adding in more hidden layers, and (if possible) running more epochs while avoiding over (and under) fitting.
